The testcases can be run by changing the project/config.json file.

The log file in project/chain-replication.da.log 

The config file can be passed from command line using the below command

python3 -m da -f project/chain-replication.da project/config.json

"clients": [
        {
          "ip_address": "IP address",
          "operation": [
            {
              "type": "random (can be random or getDeposit,getBalance and withdraw)",
              "amount": "random (can be integer)",
              "request_id": "random (can be integer)",
              "accountNumber": "random (can be integer)"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]

Duplicate transaction were done by putting the same request_id for multiple requests withing the same client.

InSufficient funds was tested by giving type = "withdraw" and an amount more than the balance.

Inconsistent request was tested by keeping the same request id for the same client but changing the type of request

Different type of transaction was tested by changing the "type" in JSON structure for each client.
